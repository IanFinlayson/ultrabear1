-------------
In order to build and install this software:
  0. Install the needed dependencies which are: SDL-devel, SDL_image-devel,
     SDL_mixer-devel, SDL_ttf-devel, scons and gcc-c++.

  1. Run "./setup configure" in the root directory.  If you want to install the

     with "./setup configure <dir>" instead.

  2. Run "./setup build" which will compile the software.

  3. Run "./setup install" as root which will copy the software to the correct
     directory.

The Galapagos font included with this game was created by Brian Kent.  The sound
effects were either created by me or based on free sound effects from the web.
