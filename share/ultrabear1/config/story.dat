     Ultra Bear lived in the north pole. He was not a smart bear. Not a smart bear at all. Oh my God!
One time he was looking for his car keys for four hours before he realized he didn't know what a car
was. Anyway, on the day our story starts, Ultra Bear woke up on his front tundra. He was never
cognizant of sleeping per se. There just existed sporadic gaps in his recent memory. He always chose not to ponder
this mystery. After brushing the snow from his fur, he got a fish out of his ice chest. Just as he was about to eat it, a
nervous little creature jumped up, grabbed the fish and scampered off twittering. Ultra Bear ate this creature instead.
Elder bear, who happened to be walking by, approached Ultra Bear.
     "Ultra Bear, do you know what that was?" he asked.
     "No" replied Ultra Bear who clearly felt that, as the animal was no more, the matter was of little interest.
     "That was a penguin", continued Elder Bear, "they usually only live in the south pole. As we only live in the north pole,
our species never cross paths. The idea that we co-exist with penguins is a common misconception."
     "So there are more of these tasty buggers in this "south" pole? And no big white bear has ever been there?" asked
Ultra Bear.
     "Ultra Bear, I've told you. You're a polar bear." said Elder Bear.
     "How did you know I'm bi-polar?" asked Ultra Bear suspiciously.
     "Look the question is..." said Elder Bear. But Ultra Bear interrupted him.
     "I have an announcement to make! I'm going to be the first big white bear to go to the south pole and teach these "penguins"
that it is not OK to be a penguin!"
     Having said this, Ultra Bear bounded off, tripped over a seal, and crawled out of site.
     "I think Ultra Bear may be a common misconception himself.", said Elder Bear as he watched him.
